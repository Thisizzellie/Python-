"""
Rename the following variables and function names
"""

# 1 - Unclean Version 
var = input("What is your first name? ")

# - Revised Version
# Descriptive name
First_name = input("What is your first name? ")
#Why 
#The revised version is better for the following reasons:
#Clearer Variable Name: Using first_name instead of var makes it immediately clear what the variable represents. Good variable names improve code readability and maintainability.

#Polite and Complete Prompt: "Please enter your first name:" is more polite and specific than "What is your first name?". It provides a clear instruction to the user about what is expected. These small improvements make the code more professional and user-friendly.
