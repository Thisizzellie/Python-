###  Snake_case 

is a naming convention commonly used in programming, especially in languages like Python. It involves writing compound words or phrases where each word is in lowercase and separated by an underscore (_). This style improves readability by clearly separating each word in the variable name.

Examples of Snake_case:

+ first_name
+ last_name
+ total_cost
+ user_id
+ Why Use Snake_case:

Readability: It makes it easier to read multi-word variable names.
Consistency: Following a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase helps in maintaining and understanding the code.
Convention: In Python, snake_case is the conventional way to name variables and functions, aligning with the language's style guide (PEP 8).

Other Naming Conventions:

+ CamelCase: Words are capitalized except the first one, with no underscores.
Example: firstName, lastName

+ PascalCase: Similar to CamelCase, but the first word is also capitalized.
Example: FirstName, LastName

+ kebab-case: Words are in lowercase and separated by hyphens.
Example: first-name, last-name (Common in URLs and CSS class names)
