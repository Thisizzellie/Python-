The base64 module in Python provides functions for encoding binary data(https://www.quanthub.com/what-is-binary-data/) to a base64-encoded string and decoding base64-encoded strings back to binary data. Base64 encoding is commonly used for encoding binary data in contexts where only text is allowed, such as in email messages and URLs. 

What is encoding and decoding: In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, and certain symbols) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.


Here are some key functions and features of the base64 module:

Encoding Function: 

1. 'base64.b64encode(data)': Encodes binary data to a base64-encoded bytes object.

import base64
data = b'Hello, World!'
encoded_data = base64.b64encode(data)
print(encoded_data)  # Output: b'SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=='
